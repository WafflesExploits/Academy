## Setup
- Build the project on Visual Studio and run Academy yourself.
- Due to an error of the SQLite Library on Visual Studio, Academy may only be open through the Visual Studio Project.
- Download the project <a href="https://github.com/WafflesExploit/Academy/releases/tag/Release">here</a>-
## Usage
- Academy can be used to assist you in your gym goals.
- Be it macros and calories, workouts or even planning your day, Academy is there **for you**.

## Project Status
 <h3 align="center"><strong>
   Unfinished</strong>
</h3>

## Room for Improvement
- Overall design -> The design at the start was more aesthetically pleasant but it evolved to a more efficient one to consume less time.
- Round buttons -> Was unable to add round buttons on the project without crashing it.
- Fixed Resolution -> Didn't take to account multiple resolutions that could be used while running academy.
- SQLite -> Couldn't find dlls for SQLite.Interop, so the programm doesn't run without being in Visual Studio, this being the reason the project will remain unfinished.

## Note
- Calories are calculted via TDEE formula:
    ```  
    TDEE = BMR*BMRM 
       Mifflin St. Jeor BMR Formula:
         Men:   BMR = 10*Weight + 6.25*Height - 5*Age + 5
         Women: BMR = 10*Weight + 6.25*Height - 5*Age - 161
       BMR Multipliers (BMRM):
          BMR X 1.2: Sedentary: little to no exercise
          BMR X 1.375: Slightly Active: exercise 1-3 days/week
          BMR X 1.465: Moderate Active: exercise 3-4 days/week
          BMR X 1.55: Active: Intense exercise 4-5 days/week
          BMR X 1.725: Very Active: intense exercise 6-7 days/week
          BMR X 1.9: Extra Active: Very hard daily exercise or physical job
    ```
